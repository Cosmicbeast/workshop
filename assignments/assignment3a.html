    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Alex Carter, a passionate and curious individual deeply intrigued by the world of technology and creativity.
            From a young age, I found myself drawn to computers—not just for games, but to understand how things work behind the scenes. 
            Over time, this curiosity evolved into a desire to build, to code, and to create meaningful digital experiences.

            Currently, I am a college student exploring fields like software development, data science, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. 
            I believe learning is a lifelong journey, and I constantly challenge myself with new projects, tutorials, and collaborations. 
            Whether it's building websites, analyzing data, or automating workflows, I find joy in turning ideas into working solutions.
        </p>

            &emsp;&emsp;Outside the digital world, I enjoy reading science fiction, sketching abstract art, and hiking in nature. 
            These activities help me stay creative, balanced, and inspired. 
            I’m always open to learning, sharing, and growing alongside like-minded individuals. 
            This page is just a small window into who I am—a thinker, a builder, and a lifelong learner.
